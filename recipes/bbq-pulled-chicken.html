        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>BBQ shredded chicken is one of those recipes you’ll be happy to have in your 
        back pocket on busy weeknights. The cooking time is mostly hands-off, it’s made with 
        just a few ingredients that you probably have on hand already, and you can do so many things with it.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li><strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> BBQ sauce</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 tsp.</strong> onion powder</li>

            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li><strong>2 lbs</strong> boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Place the chicken breasts in the bottom of the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts, covering them fully.</li>
